Web application that allows users to create a list of Youtubers to keep track of their current live streaming statuses. 

The application fetches live streaming information of a Youtube Channel using the Youtube Data API. 

Developed using Reactjs, and Styled Components.

Currently working on adding back-end functionality with Node/Express.js, and will connect to a SQL database (PostgreSQL) to store youtube channel data.
