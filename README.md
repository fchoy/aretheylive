Full Stack Web application that allows users to create a list of Youtubers to keep track of their current live streaming statuses. 

The application fetches live streaming information of a Youtube Channel using the Youtube Data API, stores the data in a SQL Database (PostgreSQL) and displays all stored rows for the user to view, delete, or modify. 

Developed using Reactjs, Styled Components, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
